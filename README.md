Dart Render Stats
=======================

[mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob) created a wonderful and simple little FPS counter for use with Three.js called [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js)

I wanted to use the same component in Dart. So I ported it!

... but don't use this one!

I was notified shortly after putting this online that [Adam Singer](https://plus.google.com/104569492481999771226) had already beaten me
to the punch. That's okay, since this was mostly an educational excercise, and his library looks better maintained than mine. :)
